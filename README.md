# IP_fragmentation
IP fragmentation is an Internet Protocol (IP) process that breaks packets into smaller pieces (fragments), 
so that the resulting pieces can pass through a link with a smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) than the original packet size. 
The fragments are reassembled by the receiving host.

This implemention is using C based on the user's input.
